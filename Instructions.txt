The CleanupApp is a small console application. When executed, it connects to a SQL database and deletes rows with a specific identifier from a set of tables.

Tasks:

1. Add a unit test for CleanupWorker to verify that the repository is called when the worker is executed. You can use any unit test framework you prefer.

2. There is at least one bug in the application that needs to be found.

3. Change the Repository.Cleanup method to be asynchronous.

4. Introduce support for a database other than SQL Server. You do not have to implement a functional solution; you can use a made-up database type.
